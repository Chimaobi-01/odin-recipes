    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Start by grinding the spices. Add them all together (ataiko, Irugege and a cup of crayfish), blend to powder. Blend the pepper as well. Wash the dried fish and remove center bones. I used dried catfish. This catfish is actually my favorite, it tastes so wonderful in soups. You need just one. Pour hot water over it, wash and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wash and precook the prawn, use half a cup of water, a seasoning cube and a pinch of salt.
            <br>
            Precook your meat, this is how – Wash properly and use two seasoning cubes and a pinch of salt. Cook the meat until it becomes easy to chew, and the water is almost dried. Add salt to taste and allow another three minutes. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Boil the palm fruit for 20 minutes, pound with a mortar and pestle, transfer into a bowl, add water and extract the juice, don’t add too much water, you want it thick. You will need about 7-10 cups of that palm fruit juice for this soup. It should be thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a sieve to strain the extract into your cooked meat.
            Allow boiling for 15 minutes with the pot half-covered. It should be a lot thicker now.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the cleaned dried fish, ground (crayfish, ataiko and irugege), oburunbebe stick, ground pepper, and salt to taste. Cover and allow another 10 minutes. You can add a little water if it is too thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the crushed dried beletientien leaves, precooked prawn, periwinkles and one cube of knorr. Stir, cover and allow to simmer for 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Serve with starch, eba or fufu.</li>
    </ol>
